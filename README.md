# Tree-Traversal-Algorithms
An interactive CLI application where a user can earch for an item in a search space using traversal algorithms

## Structure of code

The code contains three main classes:
- `Graph` : contains the algorithms for BFS and DFS
- `Node` : contains the AStar algorithm
- `IterativeDeepening` : contains the Iterative Deepening DFS algorithm
- `Main` : has the main program
